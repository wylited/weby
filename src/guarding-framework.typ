= The Guarding Mental Framework

We all have our set of mental frameworks, they guide our thinking and processing. Quite often, they change. They could be described as implicit behaviour or even better a mental software, software that constantly updates.

What is the "Guarding" mental framework. I like to think the highest or encompassing mental framework is the one that filters our inputs and outputs. It helps us understand reality and filters how we respond. A popular choice for a guarding mental framework is the stoic philosophy, where one must not react to input, self-control as a means of overcoming emotions, the becoming of the unbiased thinker. A mentat, as Herbet would put it.

Stoicism claims to allow one to understand the "universal reason", described by the Greeks as logos; pure logic itself. However, for almost everbody, a guarding mental framework will be far more complex than taking all input and outputting nothing.

Personally, my guarding mental framework is what provides me with *mental stability*. Mental Stability is highly sought after, as allows people to properly cope with constant change and fluctuations in their life. However, I did not benefit from this since birth, it constantly went through trials and tribulations to achieve what it is today.

Nowadays, the access to revelating information is unrestricted but people fail to act on it. When I was faced with mental challenges, I often times looked to external content to understand how to correct my mental framework. The complexity in the framework, almost like a firewall, arose when I began to pick parts of external frameworks that the best thinkers in humankind have crafted. I picked what felt mentally suitable for me and integrated it into my everyday. This is a part that not everyone can do, although they may be consuming revelating knowledge, it has no real revelation on them.

But although this system of integrating new concepts into our philosophies is
not disadvantageous surface level, they can expose flaws in our foundation. What
I mean by this is when the revelation is so deep and embeded within you that you need to rework everything from the ground up. I refer to this as "nuking" and I am guilty of doing this way too often. The biggest vulnerability this exposes is that your mental framework is not guarding you. Often times, during my nuking experience, while I am still rebuilding my mental framework, I often feel a surge of emotions, panic, sadness, anger that is uncontrollable and overwhelming. I am further guilty of often doing this with external projects, completly restarting my computer science game 50 hours in or resetting my entire operating system or code editor to remove "bloat". After all, a tower of babel requires a solid foundation first.

A guarding mental framework, to me, isn’t about constructing an impenetrable fortress. It’s about designing something that can withstand collapse and still retain its essence. It shifts, reforms, and learns. Perhaps a living system of thought that breathes alongside its creator. Every breakdown, every reconstruction, feels like a recalibration of the soul, each time refining the filters through which I see the world. To guard the mind is to accept that instability will visit, but to trust that your architecture can absorb it. That’s where the real strength lies, not in resisting the storm, but in learning how to keep building while it passes
