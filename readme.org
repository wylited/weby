/Cause why not/

An opinionated personal website written in typst.

** Usage
Compile with the latest version of typst for now.

~typst compile index.typ --features html --format html~

** Notes
reminder to myself to look at [[https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5512][the tracking issue]] for typst html export (and maybe even contribute if I can write good code).

** Credits

To [[https://github.com/Krasjet][@Krasjet]] for showing what is possible.

To [[https://github.com/laurmaedje][@laurmaedje] for developing typst export to html
