/Cause why not/

An opinionated personal website written in typst.

** Usage
Compile with the latest version of typst for now.

You can build the entire site using just:

~just build~

This will compile all typst files in the ~src/~ directory and output the generated HTML to the ~dist/~ directory with proper directory structure.

** Notes
reminder to myself to look at [[https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5512][the tracking issue]] for typst html export (and maybe even contribute if I can write good code).

** Credits
To [[https://github.com/sayatodev][@sayako]] for not letting me give up on this.

To [[https://github.com/Krasjet][@Krasjet]] for showing what is possible.

To [[https://github.com/laurmaedje][@laurmaedje]] for developing typst export to html
