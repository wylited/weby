/Cause why not/

An opinionated personal website written in typst.

** Compilation
If not using the nix flake.
Compile with typst version 0.13.1

You can build the entire site using just:

~just build~

This will compile all typst files in the ~src/~ directory and output the generated HTML to the ~dist/~ directory with proper directory structure.

** Serving
Optionally, you can directly serve with [[https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve][miniserve]] 
** Notes
reminder to myself to look at [[https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5512][the tracking issue]] for typst html export (and maybe even contribute if I can write good code).

** Credits
